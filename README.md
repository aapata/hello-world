# hello-world
My first repository following Github tutorial
I earned my software development diploma in 2003 but could not get my foot in the door because just having education was not enough, every hiring company was asking for previous experience which I did have - how can you have hands-on experience if nobody gives you a chance to begin with? Now years after forgetting about it, I'm coming back to it as a hobbyist.
